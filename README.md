The code for "Code similarity through natural language descriptions".

It contains many text similarity techniques, along with snippets static analysis.
 
The code was writen really long time ago and I haven't touched it since so I hope nothing is missing.
 
Pay attention that the code is based on many pre computed databases (their creation process should be somewhere on the code) anf that there are also external calls to jars creating using another Java project.
